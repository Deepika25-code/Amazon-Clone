# Amazon-Clone

This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon homepage, created using pure HTML and CSS. It includes a navigation bar with icons, a featured hero section, multiple product category boxes, and a multi-column footer—all styled to resemble Amazon’s user interface.

It serves as a solid exercise in building responsive layouts with flexbox and organizing reusable styles for real-world web components. Perfect for beginners aiming to practice clean, structured front-end development without relying on JavaScript or frameworks.
